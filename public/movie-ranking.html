 <hr />
 
 <h3>Interstella</h3>
 <p>This is the best sci-fi movie of all time. It is made by Christopher Nolan and the Music is composed by Hans Zimmer. The Story is really good and catchy. Furthermore, the actors are well chosen.</p>

 <h3>Iron Man</h3>
 <p>The best action movie is iron man. It is the beginning of the Advengers, the real big thing in Marvel Universe. Iron Man is a super hero movie with classic rock music of ACDC and great acting skills by Robert Downey Junior.

 <h3>The Blind Side</h3>
 <p>Super beautiful movie which touched my soul. Sandra Bullock is showing us that one human can change someone elses life. And what you give you will get it 10 times back. She gave a helping hand and got a wonderful big family in return.</p>
